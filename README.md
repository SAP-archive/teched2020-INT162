# INT162 - No-Code Academy: Learn to Build Process Extensions Without Code

## Description

This repository contains the material for the SAP TechEd 2020 session called INT162 - No-Code Academy: Learn to Build Process Extensions Without Code

## Overview

This session introduces attendees to how to build, run, and monitor SAP process extensions without using a single line of code. 

This is based around creating and publishing an example investment request process template in SAP Ruum. This template consists of:
- An investment request form
- A financial controlling review
- A facilities review
- A financial approval 
- A connected system (from which a purchase order is raised)

While being familiar with an investment request process is beneficial, you can still complete this workshop without any prior knowledge.

## Requirements

No development experience is required to successfully participate in this workshop.

SAP Ruum product access will be provided to all participants during the live session (with access removed after 7 days). 

Unfortunately we do not offer SAP Ruum product access if you are viewing this session on-demand. If you are interested in attend a re-run of this workshop, complete with temporary product access, please contact ruum@sap.com.
